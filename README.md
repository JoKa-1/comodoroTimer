# comodoroTimer
A simple Pomodoro Timer in C.

Currently it is only for a terminal, the goal is to add sound and a GUI.
You should be able to give a work and break time and also how often this cycle should be repeated.

It is used like: ./pomodoro <number of cycles> <work time> <break time> <break time between cylces>
And the last one is optional if the number of cycles is only one.
